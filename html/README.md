## Indentation
- HTML should use an indentation of 4 spaces, especially when integrating HTML into PHP. If you are however creating an HTML file without PHP 2 spaces is permitted but not recommended.
    > 4 spaces helps with the readability within PHP (4 spaces is required for PHP according to the PHP styleguide).
    > For files without PHP, 2 spaces is permitted (and even recommended by some other styleguides). This is up for your own preference, although we prefer 4 spaces.
